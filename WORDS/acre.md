### Historical Development

1. **Old English (before 1150):** _æcer_ — meaning “field,” especially one suitable for plowing.
   Derived from Proto-Germanic \*_akraz_ (“field”)\_.
2. **Proto-Indo-European root:** \*_agro-_ meaning “field, land, open space,” related to Latin _ager_ (“field”) and Greek _agros_ (“field, countryside”).
3. **Middle English (1150–1500):** _aker_ or _acre_ — used both as a measurement and a general term for land.
4. **Modern English (1500–present):** standardized as a land-measurement unit (approx. 4,047 m²).

### Semantic Evolution

Originally referred to any **field or open piece of land**, later standardized into a **precise land-measurement term** in agricultural and legal contexts.
