## Etymology

### Language of Origin

Latin → Old French → Middle English

### Historical Development

1. **Classical Latin:** _absurdus_ — “out of tune, discordant, foolish”

   - Derived from _ab-_ (“away from”) + _surdus_ (“deaf, dull, muted”).
   - Literally “out of hearing” → metaphorically “out of reason.”

2. **Old French:** _absurde_ — “ridiculous, unreasonable.”
3. **Middle English (15th century):** adopted as _absurd_ — meaning “contrary to reason or common sense.”

### Semantic Evolution

The meaning evolved from “out of harmony” (musical metaphor) to “illogical or foolish” and later gained philosophical significance through existentialist thinkers (e.g., Camus, Sartre).
