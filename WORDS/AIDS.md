## Etymology

### Language of Origin

Modern English (20th century)

### Historical Development

1. **1982:** The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially coined the term “AIDS.”
2. Derived from descriptive medical terminology:

   - _Acquired_ (from Latin _acquirere_, “to obtain”)
   - _Immune_ (from Latin _immunis_, “free from, exempt”)
   - _Deficiency_ (from Latin _deficere_, “to fail, lack”)
   - _Syndrome_ (from Greek _sýndromos_, “running together”)

3. The name distinguished it from congenital or inherited immune diseases.

### Semantic Evolution

Originally defined as a specific immune failure disease caused by an unknown agent (early 1980s). After the discovery of HIV in 1983–1984, the meaning became medically precise: _the final stage of HIV infection_.
