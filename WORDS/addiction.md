## Etymology

### Language of Origin

Latin → Old French → Late Middle English

### Historical Development

1. **Classical Latin:** _addictus_ — “devoted, bound, enslaved” (past participle of _addicere_, “to assign, surrender, devote”).

   - Derived from _ad_ (“to, toward”) + _dicere_ (“to say, declare”).
   - Originally referred to a debtor “assigned” to his creditor — thus, someone bound or enslaved.

2. **Old French (12th–13th century):** _addicter_ — “to devote, give oneself up to.”
3. **Middle English (14th–15th century):** _addicten_ — “to devote oneself habitually.”
4. **Modern English (17th century onward):** The term evolved into a medical and psychological sense: “habitual dependence.”

### Semantic Evolution

Originally expressing **devotion or commitment**, “addiction” gained negative connotations over time, shifting toward **loss of control** and **compulsive behavior**, especially in relation to substances or habits.
