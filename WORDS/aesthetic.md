2. **Late Latin:** _aestheticus_ — “relating to perception or sense.”
3. **French (18th century):** _esthétique_ — “relating to beauty or taste.”
4. **English (mid-18th century):** _aesthetic_ — introduced into English philosophical discourse through German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten, who used _Ästhetik_ to name the science of beauty and sensory experience.
